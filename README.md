# Block-game
This project is a Minecraft‑like game that captures the core idea of Minecraft: placing and breaking blocks. Unlike the original, the world here is intentionally very small and simple, making it easier to experiment, learn, and play around with the basic mechanics.

# Other Information
• The game is created from 60 lines of Python code.
