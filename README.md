# Block-game
This project is a Minecraft‑like game that captures the core idea of Minecraft: placing and breaking blocks. Unlike the original, the world here is intentionally very small and simple, making it easier to experiment, learn, and play around with the basic mechanics.
When the player falls off the world, the game recognizes that they are 100 blocks below it. Therefore, the game knows they are missing and teleports them back above the world. This means the player can often fall off but then reappear on the world.

# Other Information
• The game is created from 60 lines of Python code.
• There is a bug in the code, but the game will probably still run.
